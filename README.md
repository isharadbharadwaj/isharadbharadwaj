### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with over **9 years of deep experience** building robust backends. My foundation is in **PHP (Laravel/Yii2)**, where I have spent a decade architecting enterprise-grade applications.

Currently, I am pivoting to **Solution Architecture** and applying my engineering maturity to **Python and AI**. I am a language-agnostic problem solver—I don't just "know" a language; I use whatever tool is necessary to architect scalable, secure, and efficient systems.

* 🔭 **Core Strength:** Backend Engineering, API Design, and System Architecture.
* ⚡ **Current Focus:** Building AI Agents (LangGraph), RAG Systems, and Python Microservices.
* 💡 **Philosophy:** "Give me a problem, and I will architect the solution—regardless of the stack."
